# Linuxmuster Linbo GUI
A new GUI for [Linbo](https://github.com/linuxmuster/linuxmuster-linbo) based on Qt5!

# Building
For your convenience there is a script to build the package: [build.sh](./build.sh)  
You have to invoke it in the build root.  
Please note: It will take a long time to build the first time you do it.  

# Screenshots
This is what the new GUI looks like so far:  
Choosing an OS (new Layout):  
![choose](/screenshots/choose.gif)  
Choosing an OS (legacy layout):

Performing a long action (eg. syncing OS):

Autostarting an OS:
